# go_rules_engine
A basic rules / predicate engine in go


# Rules Engine
A business rules engine (BRE) is a software component that allows non-programmers to add or change business logic. A business rule is a statement that describes a business policy or procedure.

# Why GO ?
  The goals of the Go project were to eliminate the slowness and clumsiness of software development at Google, and thereby to make the process more productive and scalable. The language was designed by and for people who write—and read and debug and maintain—large software systems.

“Go has been described by several engineers here as a WYSIWYG language. That is, the code does exactly what it says on the page.” - Peter Bourgon, Go at SoundCloud

"If you are interested in creating some really fast server side applications Golang is definitely the way to go."

"When I look for a programming language I'm looking at a tool to solve a problem with a solution I can live with and that solves it    quickly so I can move on to solving the next problem. Go does this well."

**The sample rule and tests are in evaluator_test.go**
